Coding Challenge

# Challenge 2 - Enumerate all primes <= n
Write a program which takes as input an int value n and returns an array of int containing all unique primes <= n.

Example: if the value of n is 8, the function should return: {2,3,5,7}

Hint: One well-known algorithm for doing this is over 2,000 years old, but it's not the most efficient.

Remember, you are not allowed to use any primality testing functions.
